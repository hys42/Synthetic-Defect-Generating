# Synthetic-Defect-Generating

Synthetic Defect Generating (SDG) interface was developed for created by considering the literature and defects that may occur in the real environment. 
The user can edit the desired defect type, defect size, and spatial detail. Also, the processed image mask appears just below the image, and it is saved in this way.

Three main defect types, yarn, stains, and color bleeding, can be added to images processed in SDG application.  While drawing, the user can determine the pixel size and color range through the application. 

The second defect type is stains. As in yarn defect, this defect type can be encountered in the printing process when the ink solidifies, does not fully penetrate the printing surface due to problems arising from the printing material, or leaves a stain. 

This defect applies a stain or spray defect on the image using the template included in the application. The application contains 20 different template images for this defect type.
Only the black (pixel value 0) areas in the template image, where the defect addition process is used, are filled according to the pixel value received from the user. 


color bleeding type of defect can be come across in the printing process during the settings process of color mixtures or templates. This sort of defect resembles many kinds of defects such as, color fading, ink dispersion, and blurry printing.
